# Q17-TURBO (P2) 2.0</b><br>

<b>Q17-TURBO project (150W @ 8 Ohms).</b><br>

The natural evolution of the Q17-Mini, this time with two pairs of power transistors, better thermal management, better technical characteristics and the same sound signature with more punch.

An amplifier that will warm up even the coldest speakers.

# Q17 : A QUAD405 audiophile MOSFET amplifier
Q17 is an amplifier based on the QUAD405 current dumping principle.

The project for porting the operating principle of the QUAD405 to a MOSFET base was originally created by engineer Tiberiu Vicol.

<b>Q17-TURBO project (150W @ 8 Ohms)</b>

The natural evolution of the Q17-Mini, this time with two pairs of power transistors, better thermal management, better technical characteristics and the same sound signature with more punch.

An amplifier that will warm up even the coldest speakers.

The first version of the board was released on January, 6 2023.

Version 2.0.1 was released on October 5, 2024.

All files are located in Q17-TURBO-2.0 directory. Old version are located in Q17-TURBO Archives directory.

You can very simply manufacture your PCB via JLCPCB (https://jlcpcb.com) or PCBWay (https://www.pcbway.com) using the Gerber files available on this repository. You can also contact me, from time to time I have some spare copies of the Q17 PCBs that can be sold to you at cost price.

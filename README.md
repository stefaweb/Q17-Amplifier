# Q17 : A QUAD405 audiophile MOSFET amplifier
Q17 is an amplifier based on the QUAD405 current dumping principle.

The project for porting the operating principle of the QUAD405 to a MOSFET base was originally created by engineer Tiberiu Vicol.

<b>Q17-Mini project (90W @ 8 Ohms)</b>

The first version of the board was released on December 8, 2021.

Version 3.0.3 was published on September 14, 2024.

All files are located in Q17-Mini-3.0 directory. Old version are located in Q17-Mini Archives directory.

Q17-Mini v3.0 (95x75mm, 2 Oz PCB)

<b>Q17-SIGMA-PSU 1.1.1</b>

The Q17-SIGMA-PSU power supply regulator board is inspired by Ti Kan's Sigma22 circuit.

The "sigma 22" is a high-performance DIY dual-rail, tracking, linear regulated power supply (PSU).

This power supply provides a regulated up to 60vDC and 3A continuous source (or more with external heatsinks). The voltage difference between output and input is around 6V. The board is able to power an amplifier board as the Q17-Mini.

Version 1.1.1 published on April 30, 2024.

The 2 Oz PCB measures 75x130mm.

You can very simply manufacture your PCB via JLCPCB (https://jlcpcb.com) or PCBWay (https://www.pcbway.com) using the Gerber files available on this repository. You can also contact me, from time to time I have some spare copies of the Q17 PCBs that can be sold to you at cost price.
